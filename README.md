# vsix-empty-template

A template repository that contains code to start a new Visual Studio extension!

This is a very bare-bones example project that literally does nothing except build :)

There are a few things you'll want to update to "make it yours", specifically in the `EmptyVisxPackage.cs`, and the `source.extension.vsixmanifest` files.  And, you'll probably want
to rename the project, solution, and change the namespaces.
